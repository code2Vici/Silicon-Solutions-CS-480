Estimated Development Time: 7 days

Project Description:

Implementation of an interactive gradebook. Its purpose is to facilitate grading assignments with different points and placing it in the correct category where each has different weight as percentage.

Preliminary Development Plan: Developed in Java. Implementation As Specified in Requirements.


Checkpoint 1 (Day 1, 2):
Design the graphical interface for grade book program on scratch with the useful tools:
o   Term(Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer), year
o   Class
o   Students (Last, Middle, and First name)
o   Grading (assignment, weight percentage – should add up to 100% for all categories)
o   Final grade column (based on weight percentage then compute the letter Grade, user can specify the lower and upper bound to compute the letter grade)
o   Save and read the file
 
Checkpoint 2 (Day 3):
Transfer all the designs of the graphical interface to coding.
Add codes and functions to the Term, Class, and Students by using coding.
For Term, there are adding and removing functions. (Spring 2017)
Removing the Term will remove all the classes in that term.
 For Class, there are adding and removing functions. (CS 480)
Removing the class will remove all the students in that class. (including students’ grades, names)
For Students, there is a box to add student first, middle, and last name.
After adding the student to the class, show the table of student on the interface to show the student’s first, middle, and last name, and assignment with score.
Sort the list by student’s last name.

Checkpoint 3 (Day 4, 5):
Design the Grading function for the project.
 After add the student to the class, there is a button to add the assignment.
 Press the ‘add assignment’ button, the box will popup to prompt the user input the assignment number and (date) for the assignment. Then create the assignment column next to the student’s name and show to the table.
Design the weight column for the assignment
The weight column is the total points of all the assignments (computed in percentage %)
Weight = Total points the student earnedTotal points of all assignments 	
Design the Final Grade to compute the letter grade for the user
The user can specify the lower bound for each letter grade.
Pop up the box for user to input.
 
Checkpoint 4 (Day 6):
Add the saving and reading file to the program.
Do extra credit: Exporting the file as a CSV file.
 
Checkpoint 5 (Day 7):
Testing, debugging, checking the project runs properly before turn it in.
 
Checkpoint 6 (Day 8):
Due project
